Dear Friends, please take extra precautions regarding your personal safety and health during the  COVID-19 threat. If you can, try to purchase alcohol 60% or stronger and use it to regularly disinfect your mobile phone, keys, wallet, pc keyboard, door handles in your office and at home or any surfaces where you and others might touch including inside your vehicle. Also avoid touching your face. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds several times a day. Experts say that hand washing is superior to alcohol based sanitizers.

Also please be assured that our janitors are putting forth an earnest effort to diligently disinfect all common door handles, exit door push bars and all other surfaces where people can touch.  Please stay safe.

Over the years we have built up a fine reputation with a number of property management companies. The  workload for Property Managers is always high, therefore it is important that we continue to be an efficient janitorial service.

We carry liability Insurance and we are registered with the Worker's Compensation Board of B.C. We have completed the WCB - Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) course to ensure safe usage and storage of all cleaning compounds used on premises. For any further information concerning our WCB coverage and insurance please email us.

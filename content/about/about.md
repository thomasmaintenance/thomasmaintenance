Since 1990 our guarantee to our clients has been to provide a professional efficient janitorial service.  A keen attention to detail is important.

### We Value Communication

Communication is an integral part of any successful business. We pride ourselves on our efficiency to stay in close contact with Property Managers and to act quickly in carrying out their instructions. Occasionally a concern can arise which will call for an immediate response from our maintenance team. Our team will report building issues such as vandalism and graffiti.

We always display a courteous and friendly attitude which brings a greater personal touch to the work we do and contributes to a higher degree of client satisfaction.

#### "The best thing about the team from Thomas Maintenance was the peace of mind they gave us. You knew that when they left, the building was clean from top to bottom, that it smelled good and that all the little things that matter had happened during their day -- anything in need of repair had been noted, the security doors had all been left closed, the front entrance looked inviting again."

C. Montgomery, former president, The Greenhorn
